    "\n",
    "Attributes can be distinguished from methods and functions as they do\n",

    "They can be thought of as verbs that complete an action.\n",

    "\n",
    "While we write code, it’s often useful to annotate it or include\n",
    "information for humans that we do not want to executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do this is with a hash (`#`) symbol. This creates a\n",
    "single line comment and prevents anything written after it from being\n",

    "to do and what our intentions are.\n",
    "\n",
