- Write docstrings for functions following the NumPy/SciPy format.
- Write comments within a function to improve readability.
- Write and design functions with default arguments.
- Explain the importance of scoping and environments in Python as they relate to functions.
- Formulate test cases to prove a function design specification.
- Use `assert` statements to formulate a test case to prove a function design specification.
