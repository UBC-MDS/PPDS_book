    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "alt.chart(...)...\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "alt.chart(cereal)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. But what kind of plot do we want?\\! As we said before, a bar chart would be suitable for this type of data. So let’s add `.mark_bar()` to specify that.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "alt.chart(cereal).mark_bar()...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Next, we need to say what goes on the `y-axis` and the `x-axis`. We do this inside of the `encode()` call. So inside of encode, we say what should be represented on the `y-axis` and what should be represented on the `x-axis`. Here on the `x-axis`, we put the manufacturer, and on the `y-axis`, we us count: `.encode(x='mfr', y='count()')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "alt.chart(cereal).mark_bar().encode(\n",

    "frequency of each of elements in the `x` variable.\n",
